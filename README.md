  <h1>♟️ FIDE and Google Efficiency Chess AI Challenge ♟️</h1>
</div>

This is a competition that attempts to use minimal resources to create an effective Chess bot.
Rather than using a computer with a lot of computational power and resources to look through, this competition is going to have the following constraints:

- 5 MiB of RAM**
- Dedicated CPU: a single 2.20GHz core
- 64KiB compressed submission size limit
* This may be later changed from Simple delay to increment (which does bank unused time)
** RAM constraint is not exact. Expect an update which more strongly enforces this limit.
